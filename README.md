# MeGaBoT Dataset

The MeGaBoT Dataset is based on the Meta Quest Pro VR headset system. It includes tracked data for gaze, hand, and upper body joints, recorded from 20 participants (5 females, 15 males). Each participant performed three interaction types: pushing, pointing, and grasping, at 17 contact points in six directions: forward, backward, left to right, right to left, upward, and downward.
